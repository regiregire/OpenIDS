**OpenIDS: An Open-Source 3D-Printed Inkjet DNA Synthesizer**

OpenIDS (Open-Source Inkjet DNA Synthesizer) is an easy-to-build and highly scalable open-source inkjet-based microarray synthesis device built using 3D printing, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.

This project is based on the paper "An open-source, 3D printed inkjet DNA synthesizer" published in Nature Scientific Reports.

📖 Overview
Synthetic oligonucleotides are fundamental tools in a wide range of biological fields, such as synthetic biology, biosensing, and DNA storage. OpenIDS was developed to increase accessibility to equipment capable of reliably synthesizing high-density oligonucleotides in a laboratory environment.

Through low-cost fabrication and open-source hardware/software, it is designed to allow researchers, even those without expertise in mechanical or electrical engineering, to easily build, control, and modify their own DNA synthesizer.

✨ Key Features
Inkjet-Based Synthesis: Performs reliable microarray synthesis using an industrial inkjet printhead.

Open-Source: All 3D models, assembly instructions, and source code are publicly available for free download, rebuilding, and modification. (Requires adding files to the actual repository)

Low-Cost and Accessible: Fabrication costs are reduced by using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Flexible and Scalable: Structural modifications are easy, such as adding printheads or changing the microarray substrate design according to research needs.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to easily control, modify, and monitor the synthesis process.
